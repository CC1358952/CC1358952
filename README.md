# 👋 Hi, I'm Caleb Cort

🎓 I'm a second-year Finance major at the **University of Georgia – Terry College of Business**, pursuing a **Computer Science minor** and a **FinTech certificate**.

💡 I’m passionate about merging **financial insights with technology and algorithms** to drive data-informed, people-first business decisions.

📈 From analyzing the backs of baseball cards as a kid to founding my high school’s **Baseball Data & Analytics Program**, I've always loved uncovering the story behind the numbers. Today, I aim to **bridge the gap between IT and Financial teams**, translating complex data into actionable insights.
